    <h1>Lasagna</h1>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This dish is my take on an Italian classic. Initally inspired by content creator, Adam Reguesea, 
        this recipe has undergone soon alterations to fit our family's pallete. </p>
    <p>It is better if you make large batches ahead of time and rebake portions as needed. 
        The second baking really helps to bring out flavors and aromas.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1lb of ground meat</li>
        <li>Onions</li>
        <li>Carrots</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Red wine</li>
        <li>Chicken Stock Pot</li>
        <li>Tomato Puree</li>
        <li>Oregano</li>
        <li>Crushed Tomatos</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Cheese</li>
        <li>Shredded Mozerella</li>
        <li>Lasagna Sheets</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Step One: Finely dice your onions, carrots, and garlic. Saute in a tablespoon of butter or olive oil. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Step Two: In the same pan, brown your ground meat. Let fry in it's own released fat until sticking to the bottom of the pan.
            Add chicken stock pot and Tomato puree. Continue to cook until browning the bottom of the pan. Deglaze with red wine. </li>
        <li>Step Three: Add crushed tomatos. Reduce heat to low and simmer for at least three hours</li>
        <li>Step Four: Create a rue with butter, flour, and milk. Add shredded cheese of your choosing. Consistency should be thin to account for
            lasagna sheets soaking up exess liquid </li>
        <li>Step Five: Season both sauces to taste. </li>
        <li>Step Six: Layer sheets alternating between cheese and meat sauces. Ensure proper hydration by putting a dash of water or milk on
            top of each noodle layer.</li>
        <li>Step Seven: Top with shredded mozzerella and bake at 400F for one hour.</li>
        <li>Opitional: Freeze and reheat in the oven at a later date. (tastes better)</li>
    </ol>
